# Suggested Client-Side Mods for Mission Making

There are a number of highly useful client-side mods you can load for making and running missions.


[Here](mods.html){:download="ca_mm_mods.html"} is a modlist you can load into the regular Arma launcher to easily download all of the below mods. Open the Arma launcher, click PRESET on the top right, and then Import. Then, hit Play to ensure they are fully installed and able to be used with Swifty.

You can then use them with Swifty by following the instructions [here](../arma_3/swifty_getting_started.md#optional-client-side-mods).


!!! Note
    Client-side mods can add dependencies that will make your mission unplayable for those without the mods loaded. The mods listed here are OK, but be careful when adding others.
