# Mission Making with CA

Thanks for your interest in making missions with CA!

To make a mission with CA, we require that you use our framework, called CAFE3. The framework contains many features and additions to make mission making easier and more consistent. 

To learn how to use the framework, follow the guides starting with [how to install it](framework/installing_framework.md) and the [core configuration](framework/core_configuration.md). You can find a video version of these guides [here](https://youtu.be/8wgFG25JnVc){:target="_blank"}.

Once you have the base of your mission configured, you can either configure the [additional features](framework/optional_config.md), or just proceed to making the mission!

You can find some tips and tricks for mission making [here](tips.md). 

Once you are finished with the mission, see the guide [here](framework/uploading.md) for instructions on getting it on the server and the slotting website.

You can find some client-side mods that are helpful for mission making and running [here](suggested_addons.md).
