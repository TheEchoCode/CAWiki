# Getting started

## Joining the community


## Installing the mods
We use Swifty to download and mange our Arma 3 mods, how to install and setup the mods can be found in this [guide](swifty_getting_started.md).

## Joining an event
We run COOP missions every Sunday, and usually a more casual event on Saturdays. 

Signing up for these missions just involves using a slotting bot on our Discord server! Be sure to show up on TS and the game server in time and don't be afraid to ask an Officer or Moderator for help!
