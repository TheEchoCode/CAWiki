# Repos and CDLC

## Repos
???+ Note
	Remember to include the http:// at the start in your Swifty address.

	Instructions for installing can be found at the Swifty [guide](swifty_getting_started.md#adding-a-new-mod-list-aka-repository)

We use repos to organize our mods. You do not need to download all of them, but if you set them all to the same path they will share files and not duplicate downloads. Mission makers will announce on the slotting page and in the briefing which repo a mission uses.
