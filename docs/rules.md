# CA Rules

<!-- Suggest to reorder the rules -->

To help us achieve the core principles, we've instituted the following rules - please help us build a better place to play by following them!

1. Membership of Combined Arms is a privilege, and not a right.

2. Don’t be a dick.

3. No recruiting - including posting discord links or recruitment links - even if it's a link to a non-arma3 discord.

4. Treat others with respect, especially those you don’t know well. Make all guests & members welcome, especially those who are new to the community.

5. We take a zero tolerance policy to any form of Racist/Homophobic/Derogatory language - it is not acceptable for use in any Combined Arms forum, even when used in a non-serious or "joking" manner. Additionally for clarity, the use of the term "trap" is a slur. Do not expect leniency from CA staff if you are using slurs.

6. CA is foremost a place to play games and escape the real world - political, religious, and similar discussions are therefore prohibited. LGBT+ issues are explicitly not considered "political" as the validity of any chosen identity of any individual is not considered open for debate. We remind everyone to follow rules 2 & 4 at all times.

7. Personal attacks on any individuals or groups either inside or outside of CA will not be tolerated.

8. Do not bait/convince any other person into breaking the rules.

9. Green member tags "gatekeep" many of our discord channels. To get green tags you must attend 2 or more arma 3 events over more than one weekend. An officer or moderator will apply these tags once you meet the criteria. If you think you have been missed out, PM an officer.

10. Under normal circumstances, members of the community will be subject to a "three strikes" warning policy for rule breaches before receiving a permanent ban. The moderation team reserves the right to bypass this guideline at their discretion for any reason, at any time. 
11. All disciplinary decisions are at the moderation team's discretion, and we reserve the right to ban anyone, for anything, at any time.

12. You must be aged 18+ to play with CA.

13. @Moderators are the members of CA's staff that make decisions on behalf of CA and run the organisation's schedule and infrastructure. @Officers are the members of CA's staff that manage the day-to-day jobs of the community like looking after new members and helping the community in any way they can. If you are new or need help, please ping @Officers in ⁠help and someone will come and assist you!

14. We consider the base game & the apex and contact DLCs to be core content - if you do not own the apex and contact DLC packs then you may struggle to attend events as we no longer identify non-apex and non-contact events/slots. All other DLC is optional but as previous, may restrict your ability to play some slots & events.

15. As per Discord Terms of Service, all gun & firearms related content must be kept to mil-general.
