# Hosting an event

This page is targeted against bigger, "official", events. This page is not for smaller events such as when you are looking for a smaller amounts of players for a coop game, do that in the appropriate channels on discord and create a discord event for that (ask moderators/officers if permission to create event is not available). 

**Things to keep in mind when hosting an event**:

* When is the event happening?
* What game is the event focused on?
* Does it require something to be prepared? For example a mission, server to be configured etc. 
* Test it a *sensible* amount of time before the event takes place, on the hardware it intends to run on. 

    "Works on my machine" doesn't neccessarily mean it works on the server for the event. If you need help testing there is always some people which are happy to help out. 

## Scheduling an event


CA usually have a weekly event on sundays, and more often than not also on saturdays. Events are not limited to those days but will most likely have lower attendance due to work and timezones. 

The standard event time is ``19:00 UTC`` during ***european summer time*** and ``20:00 UTC`` during ***european winter time***. The date when summer time starts and ends changes each year, check out this [wikipedia link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Summer_time_in_Europe#Table_of_transition_dates_for_European_Summer_Time) for the date of current year.
